# QEMU KVM (Limbor) For Tensor-based devices 

Limbo for Tensor is a QEMU-based Hypervisor for Tensor-based Google Pixel devices such as Pixel 6 & 7 series.

Limbo utilizes Kernal KVM feature from Exception Level 2 hypervisor privilege level. 

Currently only Google Tensor SOC support the feature. ROOT access is REQUIRED to access Kernal KVM.

    - local only on port `8021` (telnet:127.0.0.1:8021)
    - local and LAN on `8021` (telnet:0:8021)
3. Mouse:
   - usb-tablet (good on VNC)
   - usb-mouse

>### Board 
1. Machine Type: use virt
2. CPU Model: use max or host
3. CPU Core: up to 8
4. RAM Momory: up to 8192MB
5. Enable UFEI:
   - Enable: can boot generic Linux ISO image
   - Disableï¼šcan only boot via linux Kernel and Initrd
6. Enable KVM:
   - Enable: can use KVM virtualization solution
   - Disable: disable virtualization mode

>### Disks: used to store data drive

>### Removeable 
1. CDROM: can be used to install OS. Disable it after installation
2. SD Card: Do not use it is currently broken, and will be removed later

>### Boot (Do not modify if UEFI is enabled)

4. Host Forword: not working

>### USB
1. Can Passthrough USB 3.0 Device to VMs
2. Input device path follows (BusID).(DeviceID) You can use 3rd APPs eg (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=usbdevicem.indvel.app.usbdevicemanager) to find out.
3. If the Device Path is "/dev/bus/usb/003/004", You input is "3.4"
4. You need to connect the device before the VM starts. You can disconnect devices while running the VMs.
