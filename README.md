# QEMU KVM (Limbor) For Tensor-based devices 

Limbo for Tensor is a QEMU-based Hypervisor for Tensor-based Google Pixel devices such as Pixel 6 & 7 series.

Limbo utilizes Kernal KVM feature from Exception Level 2 hypervisor privilege level. 

Currently only Google Tensor SOC support the feature. ROOT access is REQUIRED to access Kernal KVM.
